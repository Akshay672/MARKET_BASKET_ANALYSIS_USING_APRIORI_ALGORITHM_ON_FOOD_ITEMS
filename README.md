### Market Basket Analysis

##### Market Basket Analysis is the process of discovering frequent item sets in large transactional database is called market basket analysis.

### Example:

### Assosciation rules are produced using algorithms like :

#### 1. Apriori Algorithm

#### 2. Eclat Algorithm

#### 3. FP-growth Algorithm
